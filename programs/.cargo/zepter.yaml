# The examples in this file assume crate `A` to have a dependency on crate `B`.
workflows:
  # Check that everything is good without modifying anything:
  check:
    - [
        "lint",
        # Check that `A` activates the features of `B`.
        "propagate-feature",
        # These are the features to check:
        "--features=cpi,no-entrypoint,no-idl,no-log-ix-name,idl-build",
        # Do not try to add a new section into `[features]` of `A` only because `B` expose that feature. There are edge-cases where this is still needed, but we can add them manually.
        "--left-side-feature-missing=ignore",
        # Ignore the case that `A` it outside of the workspace. Otherwise it will report errors in external dependencies that we have no influence on.
        "--left-side-outside-workspace=ignore",
        # Some features imply that they activate a specific dependency as non-optional. Otherwise the default behaviour with a `?` is used.
        "--feature-enables-dep=serde:serde",
        # Show the paths of failed crates to have them clickable in the terminal: 
        "--show-path",
      ]
      # Format the features into canonical format:
    - ["format", "features", "--offline", "--locked", "--quiet"]
  # Same as `check`, but actually fix the issues instead of just reporting them:
  default:
    - [$check.0, "--fix"]
    - [$check.1, "--fix"]

# Will be displayed when any workflow fails:

    Nitro Labs uses the Zepter CLI to detect abnormalities in the feature configuration.
    It looks like one more more checks failed; please check the console output. You can try to automatically address them by running `zepter`.
